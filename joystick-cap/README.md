# Sonata Board Joystick Cap

This directory contains a simple 3D model for a cap designed to fit on the 
little [5-position joystick](https://www.te.com/en/product-2425755-1.html) 
on the Sonata development board to make it a little more ergonomic.

[The source](sonata-joystick-cap.scad) is an [OpenSCAD](http://openscad.org) 
file and, for convience, the compiled [STL file](sonata-joystick-cap.stl) that 
should work with any 3D printer.

The printed cap should have a diameter of 12mm and 3.5mm<sup>2</sup> hole to fit on the 3.2mm<sup>2</sup> joystick.
This worked well for me but you might need to adjust the size slightly to suit your 3D printer resolution etc.
